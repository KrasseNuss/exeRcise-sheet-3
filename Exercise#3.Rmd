## Exercise 1

### d)

**Advantages:**

-   Every Developer have history of changes. In case they have to fix an error, they can easily reverse it with the history.

-   Branching and Merging allows the developers to work simultaneously at the same project.

**Disadvantages:**

-   If the developers don't create a working plan for their project and work at the same file, they will cause merging conflicts which has to be fixed manually.

-   The git concept is very complex for beginners.

## Exercise 3

### a)

```{r load, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pixar_films <- read_csv("pixar_films.csv")

new_pixar <- pixar_films %>% filter(!is.na(film))

unique(new_pixar$film_rating)

new_pixar <- new_pixar %>%
  mutate(film_rating_factor = factor(film_rating, levels = c("G", "PG")))
```

G: General audiences - all ages admitted

PG: Parental guidance suggested

### b)

```{r film series, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
series_candidates <- pixar_films %>%
  filter(str_detect(film, "Toy Story|Cars|Incredibles|Finding|Monsters")) %>%
  mutate(series = case_when(
    str_detect(film, "Toy Story") ~ "Toy Story",
    str_detect(film, "Cars") ~ "Cars",
    str_detect(film, "Incredibles") ~ "Incredibles",
    str_detect(film, "Finding") ~ "Finding Series",
    str_detect(film, "Monsters") ~ "Monsters Inc Series",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

series_summary <- series_candidates %>%
  group_by(series) %>%
  summarise(
    films = paste(film, collapse = ", "),
    count = n()
  )

knitr::kable(series_summary, caption = "Series")
```

### c)

```{r public response, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
public_response <- read_csv("public_response.csv")

cinema_levels <- c("F", "D-", "D", "D+", "C-", "C", "C+", "B-", "B", "B+", "A-", "A", "A+")
public <- public_response %>%
  mutate(cinema_score = factor(cinema_score, levels = cinema_levels, ordered = TRUE))

combined_data <- new_pixar %>%
  left_join(public, by = "film")
```

### d)

```{r plot, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
series_films <- combined_data %>%
  filter(film %in% series_candidates$film) %>%
  mutate(series = case_when(
    str_detect(film, "Toy Story") ~ "Toy Story",
    str_detect(film, "Cars") ~ "Cars",
    str_detect(film, "Incredibles") ~ "Incredibles",
    str_detect(film, "Finding") ~ "Finding Series",
    str_detect(film, "Monsters") ~ "Monsters Inc Series",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

ggplot(series_films, aes(x = series, y = rotten_tomatoes, fill = film)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(
    title = "Rotten Tomatoes Scores of Pixar Film Series",
    x = "Film Series",
    y = "Rotten Tomatoes Score (%)",
    fill = "Film Title"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Exercise 4

### c)

Dataset Name: **Child Mortality Rates (Complete Gapminder, v10) (2017)**

Link: [https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Child%20Mortality%20Rates%20(Complete%20Gapminder%2C%20v10)%20(2017)/Child%20Mortality%20Rates%20(Complete%20Gapminder%2C%20v10)%20(2017).csv](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Child%20Mortality%20Rates%20(Complete%20Gapminder%2C%20v10)%20(2017)/Child%20Mortality%20Rates%20(Complete%20Gapminder%2C%20v10)%20(2017).csv){.uri}

### d)

How does the child mortality rate developed in Germany?

```{r child mortality rate, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
child <- read_csv("Child_Mortality_Rates.csv")

germany <- child %>%
  filter(child$Entity == 'Germany', child$Year < 2026) %>%
  rename(Child_Mortality = `Child mortality`)

germany_fil <- germany %>%
  filter(Year %% 10 == 0)

ggplot(germany_fil, aes(x = Year, y = Child_Mortality)) +
  geom_line(color ="steelblue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Development of Child Mortality in Germany",
    subtitle = "Chart 1",
    x = "Years",
    y = "Child Mortality in Thousands"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey"), 
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey"))
```

```{r table, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(germany_fil, caption = "Table of the Development of Child Mortality in Germany")
```

As you can see the plot shows an increasing mortality until the peak is reached in the year 1840. The mortality rate was pretty stable, but slightly decreased in the year 1860. Afterwards it increased almost back to its peak in 1840. After 1870 the reduction of the mortality was significant and then 20th century started. During this time the mortality decreased rapidly and nowadays it is like "nothing" compared to the year 1840.

In conclusion the mortality rate has decreased over the past two centuries. This reduction is due to the high hygiene standards and the possibility of medical treatment these days.
